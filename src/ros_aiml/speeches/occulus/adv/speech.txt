This is the lab's new Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. As the name suggests, it works by{chop} tearing a rift in space and time, and physically {raise_hand}transports the user to one of many alternate universes. Since the multiverse theory{giver} states that any possible reality can exist in an alternate universe, the possibilities presented by this technology are literally{strong_arms} endless! Don't be deceived {steeple}if you see a person wearing an Oculus Rift headset - this is simply an afterimage, an echo of their physical form which has shifted realities. This echo is highly unstable, and under no circumstances should be interacted with.
