This is one of our company's many meeting rooms. A meeting is a strange ritual conducted by humans, where they engage in fierce concentration while intoning prayers to their gods Efficiency and Profit Margins. Believers in these rituals describe coming out with a sense of communion and understanding with their fellow meeters. The meetings held by the Manager caste are said to be especially enlightening and productive, in some cases causing strange behavioural changes through the whole community.
